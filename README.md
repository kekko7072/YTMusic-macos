# YTMusic (by kekko)

> **Because who has time to open a browser just to listen to music?**

A ridiculously simple macOS app that wraps YouTube Music in a window. That's it. That's the whole thing.

## Why?

- No more losing your music tab among 47 browser tabs
- Login once, forget forever (until you clear cookies)
- It's an app! In your Dock! Revolutionary!
- Menu bar access because we're fancy like that

## Setup

1. Open `YTMusic-macos.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Hit CMD+R to build and run
3. Log in once
4. Never log in again (until you do something dumb)

## What It Does

It opens `https://music.youtube.com` in a window. That's literally it.

Your cookies are saved so you stay logged in. It has a menu bar item (?) because why not.

## Honest Talk

This is a weekend project because I was tired of:
- Opening Safari just for music
- Losing my music tab
- Logging in every freaking time

So I made this wrapper. It's not fancy. It's not smart. It just works.

## License

MIT - Do whatever you want. It's a wrapper around a website.

## Credits

- YouTube Music for existing
- Apple for WKWebView
- Me (kekko) for having too much free time

**P.S.** If YouTube changes something and this breaks, blame them, not me.
